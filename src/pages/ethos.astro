      ML Mondays is built on curiosity, collaboration, and responsibility.
      We believe in learning by building, sharing knowledge openly, and

      reproducible, and genuinely useful. We encourage thoughtful discussion,
      ethical thinking in AI & ML, and a supportive community where everyone
      can grow together.
