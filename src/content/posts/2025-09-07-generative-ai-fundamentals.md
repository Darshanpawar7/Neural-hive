# Generative AI Fundamentals: The Complete Guide to Foundation Models and Creative Intelligence

Generative AI has captured the world's imagination... (content reconstructed)

## What is Generative AI?
Generative AI refers to models that can produce new content — text, images, audio, or code — often using large pretrained models.

## Foundation models
Foundation models are large-scale models trained on broad data that can be fine-tuned...

### Transformers
Explain attention, self-attention, encoder-decoder blocks...

### Diffusion and Likelihood models
Explain diffusion models and sampling procedure...

## Use cases
- Image generation
- Text synthesis
- Code generation
- Creative assistance

## Ethical considerations
- Bias and safety
- Attribution and copyright
- Misuse prevention

## Key takeaways
- Foundation models provide broad capabilities
- Fine-tuning and RLHF are common to align behaviors
- Responsible deployment is mandatory
