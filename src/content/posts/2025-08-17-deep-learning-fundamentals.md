# Deep Learning Fundamentals: Understanding the Brain-Inspired Revolution in AI

Deep learning has emerged as one of the most transformative technologies...

## The basics: neurons and layers
Neural networks are composed of layers of neurons...

## Training and optimization
Loss, gradient descent, Adam, regularization...

## Architectures
CNNs, RNNs, Transformers...

## Evaluation and best practices
Cross-validation, overfitting, monitoring
